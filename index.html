            <h1>Emmett's Recipes</h1>
            <p>This is a page where I'm going to put a whole bunch of heckin' recipes. By that, though, I really mean there will be only two recipes, and of those, honestly, only one is going to even resemble a recipe. It's for class, don't judge me.</p>
            <p><strong>The recipes I'll be covering today</strong> are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="recipes/alfredo.html">Chicken alfredo</a></li>
                <li><a href="recipes/troll.html">Ratatouille</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>So feel free to click into one of those babies and let me know how your cookin' goes!</p>
